# Sketched Design to Code Generation: LLM vs Computer Vision based Deep Learning

This is a continued more refined work of the pre-print paper: [Sketch2Fullstack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14607v1) .


We started working on the paper back during 2020, when GPT-3 was yet to shake the world. As such, we did not consider comparing LLM based approaches with our Computer Vision and DL based approach. However, due to the recent trend, and the powerful capability of LLMs we decided to extend our research further and add comprehensive comparison for our models in generating code from different schemas. We propose to compare multi-model opensource models, their training (finetuning on pretrained data) , inference costs versus the training and inference costs with Computer Vision based models.

In our previous work the integration of the different aspects (frontend web pages, database and class diagram  and their respective datasets) were not properly disclosed.

One other purpose of this repo is to have a proper directory containing all the necessary codes, datasets, and documents of the research project and also to build upon it.
